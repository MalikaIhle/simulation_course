Annotated R syntax file used to introduce simulations during the class on March 11 2019


## Hallgren 2014 Tutor Quant Methods Psychol. 2013 Oct 12;9(2):43-60.

Annotated R syntax file for Example 1: "novel question.R"
Annotated R syntax file for Example 2: "power analysis.R"
Annotated R syntax file for Example 3: "bootstrapping.R"

CSV dataset generated in Example 1, which is also used later in Example 2: "novel_question_output.csv"
CSV dataset used in Example 3: "mediation_raw_data.csv"


## Ihle 2019 - Winsor, Taylor in prep

Annotated R syntax file corresponding to a preregistered statistical model: "glm_Freq_vs_YN.R"
This simulation assesses whether generalized inear model perform similarly  
when based on a contingency table summarizing counts  
vs a table with one line per record, and with the binomial variable (Yes/No) as the dependent variable
